# Designing-Ring-Oscillator-or-spintronics-based-PUF
## Introduction:
Hardware security has become increasingly important over the last few years due to security threats such as reverse engineering, cloning, and secret extraction from integrated circuits (ICs). A physical unclonable function (PUF) based on Ring Oscillator (RO) technology is examined in this project as a hardware security measure. As a result of inherent manufacturing variations, PUFs provide unique, device-specific responses, making them a valuable tool for applications requiring secure key generation and device authentication.
## CMOS Inverter-Based Ring Oscillator: 
This basic ring oscillator consists of a loop of CMOS inverters, known for their simple implementation and low power consumption. In Ring Oscillator (RO) Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), an array of ring oscillators generates unique device signatures by oscillating at frequencies influenced by small manufacturing variations. Each oscillator's frequency differences yield a unique binary signature for each device, which is consistent but difficult to replicate. Despite their effectiveness, CMOS inverters can be sensitive to environmental changes, such as temperature and voltage variations, affecting performance and PUF reliability.
